                <p id='about' class='p-5 pb-0 pt-2'>
                I'm originally from Driggs, Idaho, and I graduated from Utah State 
                University with a degree in wealth management. During my time at USU, 
                I started an e-commerce business called FortuneFavorites, which sparked
                 my passion for working with data.

                <p id='about' class='p-5 pb-0 pt-0'>
                I then pursued a data analytics program at Bridgerland Technical College,
                 after which I delved into data science, data engineering, and machine learning through 
                 various online programs.
                  Machine learning and AI have become my primary focus, and I'm excited to 
                  be part of shaping the future.
                    
                </p>

                In addition to my data-driven pursuits, I've ventured into the realms of both 
                front-end and back-end development. Along the way, I've crafted financial trading
                 bots and brought numerous projects to fruition, this portfolio being one of them.
                 I am dedicated to using data and technology to drive innovation.
